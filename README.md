<!-- About the Project -->

## About the Project

This authentication server project builds upon a secure template, with an even stronger focus on advanced security measures. Designed to streamline the integration of user authentication for web or mobile applications, it leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to establish secure, reliable user sessions. However, beyond basic authentication, this server is engineered with enhanced security features to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks, offering an extra layer of protection for your application and user data.

Built with Express.js and TypeScript, the server is highly customizable, allowing you to extend and adapt its functionality to fit specific requirements while maintaining a rigorous security standard. By integrating this robust authentication solution into your application, you can ensure that user data and sessions are well safeguarded, freeing you to concentrate on other critical components of your project, confident in the strong security foundation.

<!-- Database -->

### Database

Our server relies on MySQL as its primary database management system to store and manage all relevant data. MySQL is a popular and widely used open-source relational database system that provides efficient, secure, and scalable storage and retrieval of data.

To simplify and streamline the process of managing the data stored in the MySQL database, we utilize Prisma, which is a modern, type-safe ORM that supports various databases, including MySQL.

Prisma helps us to write database queries in a more readable and intuitive way, making it easier to manage the data stored in our MySQL database. By using Prisma as our ORM of choice, we can also ensure that our application remains scalable, efficient, and maintainable.

If you're interested in the structure of our database, you can take a look at the data model presented below, which provides an overview of the tables, columns, and relationships within the database.

```js
model User {
  id                     String                   @id @default(cuid())
  name                   String
  email                  String?                  @unique
  password               String
  emailVerified          DateTime?
  createdAt              DateTime                 @default(now())
  updatedAt              DateTime                 @updatedAt
  provider               String?
  emailVerificationToken EmailVerificationToken[]
  refreshTokens          RefreshToken[]
  resetToken             ResetToken[]
}

model RefreshToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  token     String   @unique
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model ResetToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  token     String   @unique
  expiresAt DateTime
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model EmailVerificationToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  token     String   @unique
  expiresAt DateTime
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```
